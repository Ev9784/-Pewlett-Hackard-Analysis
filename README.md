# Analysis Overview 
Our team was assigned the phenomenal task of aiding Pewlett Hackard with workforce employee distro. Pewlett Hackard has tasked our team with creating an SQL library for future retirees and mentors. 

We gathered all the CSV files and imported them into their correct SQL database tables to start collecting the number of employees, their titles, and easily readable data on who will be eligible for future mentorship. This allows us to know what roles will assume to be accessible. As the era of boomers is meeting an all-time high for retirement, who will also help mold and mentor the future workplace.
